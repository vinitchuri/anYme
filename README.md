## Features that I want to add

* Different way to present the Anime to the user (more detailed, smaller/no image for slow phones)


## Things you should know

* The app only requires the Internet Permission
* You can use a third party app to download videos from anYme.
* If you want, you can disable sending me crash reports in the settings (though this will make fixing bugs more difficult)

* Internet connection if you want to sync with MyAnimeList
* An app that can play videos such as MX Player or VLC


###### I'm a fan of Open Source, so I will probably release my app on BitBucket once I am happy with my code. Since I am still learning Android Development, I do not want to release bad code (because it will influence new programmers). I also do not want someone else to improve my code since that would interfere with my learning experience. I understand that this contradict the whole idea of collaborative programming, but I want to achieve the basics by doing it myself.
