## Things you should know

* There is a setting page where you can customize parts of the app
* This is a community-driven app. I'll add features which you can request on www.reddit.com/r/anYme. If there is something you don't like, make sure you message me.
* The app only requires the Internet Permission
* You can use a third party app to download videos from anYme (like https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dv.adm)
* Android 4.0.4 or greater is required
* I recommend that you download [MX Player to watch videos](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mxtech.videoplayer.ad)
* I am still a junior Android Dev, in the feature I'll probably release the source code of the app once I am happy with it.


###### I'm a fan of Open Source, so I will eventually release my app here on GitHub once I am happy with my code. Since I am still learning Android Development, I do not want to release bad code (because it will influence new programmers). I also do not want someone else to improve my code since that would interfere with my learning experience. I understand that this contradict the whole idea of collaborative programming, but I want to achieve the basics by doing it myself.
